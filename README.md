# Applied-Linear-Algebra-Using-Python

Folder "A. Applied Linear Algebra Self-Made Functions" consists of the programming assignment of creating self-made functions without the use of majority in-built functions, to achieve Python implementation of Applied Linear Algebra concepts and operations. These functions are used in the further development of the final project, contained in the folder "B. Applications of Linear Algebra in Chemistry".

Folder "B. Applications of Linear Algebra in Chemistry" consists of the final Applied Linear Algebra project that balances chemical equations using the linear algebra concept of solving a system of linear equations using matrices and echelon forms. 

Further details are provided in these folders.

Developed between October - November 2022.
