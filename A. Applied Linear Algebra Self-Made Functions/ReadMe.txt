This program consists of functions for applied linear algebra concepts and operations.
These also serve further purpose in the main project [Applications of Applied Linear Algebra in Chemistry] where I make use of these functions in order to develop a system that balances chemical equations using the implementation of solving a system of linear equations using applied linear algebra. 

The guidelines are as follows.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aim: Keep the code modular and define functions for the following:

a. Inverse of a Matrix 

b. Multiplication of a Matrix 
- Also check if you can find any optimized method and implement 

c. Solve a system of linear equations – Homogenous and Non-Homogenous

d. Represent the vectors (Plotting the vectors in 2-D and 3-D Plane and demonstrating it) 

e. Calculate the Norm of a matrix 

f. Row reduction of matrices – Calculate the ref/rref of the matrix 

g. Rank of a Matrix

Note: Some of these have complex edge cases and you are not expected to handle them. 
Think of basic matrices and illustrate that your Program runs well on those without worrying about complex edge cases.

Libraries and Inbuilt functions: The students are requested to refrain from using the functions of libraries for carrying out Linear Algebra Operations. They have to define their own functions and use them. That is why we have given the exercise of building Primers for the Project. This will be super useful going ahead with the Project as these functions can be directly used in your main code. The students are allowed to declare numpy or scipy arrays or do manipulations in dataframes but inbuilt functions are not encouraged.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have avoided using in-built functions to a great extent; Much time, observation, thinking and organization has been devoted in these functions. The functions were programmed using Python in Visual Studio Code editor.

The output results have been commented in the bottom-most part of the code in the documentation. The images generated from the vector operations have been saved in this directory itself.

This was developed in October 2022, as a part of a Programming Assignment for our Applied Linear Algebra course in the 3rd Semester (2nd Year) of my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering Programme.
